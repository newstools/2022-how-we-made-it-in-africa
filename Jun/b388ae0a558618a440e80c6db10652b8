Rwanda has a shortage of commercial refrigerated vehicles, presenting a potential business opportunity for entrepreneurs. So said Mark Sproston, CEO of food distribution company GET IT, in a recent interview with How we made it in Africa. GET IT is a Rwanda-based distributor of fruits, vegetables and dry goods to businesses and households. It sources its fresh produce from both its own farming operations as well as third-party smallholder farmers. Getting the produce from the farms remains challenging, particularly for fragile fruits and vegetables, like lettuce and cherry tomatoes. “For these products, we send a refrigerated truck, which brings them to our processing facility in Kigali to be washed, sorted, cut and trimmed,” said Sproston. “At one point there were only six refrigerated trucks available for commercial rental in Kigali. While there are more now, it is still not enough, and we often have to rent directly from private operators. I have been approached by various players in the region who are considering a business to address this shortage. I expect a large player on the ground very shortly,” he explained. CEO of Rwanda-based food distribution company shares his experiences and highlights growth opportunities in the region. Businessman Herve Tuyishime explains how he capitalised on opportunities in the meat production industry. Founder of Afri Foods explains how she started and grew a company that exports crops such as chilli, avocado, eggplant and passion fruit to Europe and Dubai. From making fish sausages in Uganda to exporting Kenya's macadamia nuts, these 11 entrepreneurs are taking advantage of opportunities in East Africa’s agribusiness and food industry. Dennis Ngabirano explains how a side hustle became a fully fledged commercial food business. “One of our company’s focus areas is to connect trade between Africa and Asia," says Desmond Tay, CEO of trade technology company GUUD.
