Recent figures obtained by How we made it in Africa reveal the biggest African importers of French champagne, with South Africa, Nigeria and Côte d’Ivoire in the top three places. According to Comité Champagne, a trade association that represents producers in the Champagne wine region of France, the industry was re-invigorated in 2021 after being badly hit in 2020. Sales made a strong comeback, increasing by 31% to 320 million bottles and returning to levels comparable to those seen in the early 2010s. This comeback was even more pronounced when it came to turnover, with total sales amounting to a never-before-seen €5.7 billion. These results are to a large extent attributable to a dynamic export market, with exports reaching 180 million bottles for the first time, accounting for over 56% of all champagne sales.
