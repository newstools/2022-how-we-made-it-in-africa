The Henley Passport Index is a ranking of the globe’s passports according to the number of destinations their holders can access without a prior visa. The index includes 199 passports and 227 travel destinations. “Each passport is scored on the total number of destinations that the holder can access visa-free. For each travel destination, if no visa is required, then a score of 1 is allocated for that passport. This also applies if passport holders can obtain a visa on arrival, a visitor’s permit, or an electronic travel authority (ETA) upon entry. Where a visa is required, or where a passport holder must apply for a government-approved electronic visa (e-visa) before departure, a score of 0 is assigned. The same applies if they need pre-departure approval for a visa on arrival,” explains Henley & Partners, a residence and citizenship advisory firm that compiles the index. Overall Japan has the world’s most powerful passport, with visa-free access to 193 countries, followed by Singapore and South Korea. Afghanistan has the weakest passport; holders can only visit 27 countries without obtaining a visa. The majority of African countries fall in the bottom-half of the list.
